blog.html
- add a side navigation <aside> or offcanvas, which outlines the articles by topic. can implement scrollspy
- add a Preview button which opens a modal showing the first paragraph of the article?? can think of btr implementation
maybe instead of a linear scroll down to show the articles we can do carousels for each topic. maybe even implement camillemormal style carousel

saved posts -> dynamic DOM rendering
in blog.html on each article add a save button or a like button
on a separate page like favourites.html can show all the users' saved articles and render their article card onto the screen
take inspiration from coding2go note taking app, add <dialog> tag for when there are no posts saved yet
add button click animations for save/favourite
